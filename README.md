Blog Website
Introduction
Welcome to the Blog Website! This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. This stack allows developers to create powerful web applications using JavaScript for both the front end and back end.

What is the MERN Stack?
MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Itâ€™s great for handling large amounts of data.
Express: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of server-side applications.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing developers to create dynamic and responsive web pages.
Node.js: A runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server, enabling server-side scripting.
Features
User Authentication
JWT (JSON Web Token): Used for secure user authentication, allowing users to log in and access protected routes.
bcrypt: A library used to hash passwords, enhancing security by protecting user credentials.
File Uploads
Multer: A middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js, enabling users to upload images for their blog posts.
Rich Text Editor
Quill: A powerful, modern rich text editor for creating and formatting blog content easily. It offers a user-friendly interface for writing posts.
Notifications
Toast Notifications: Used to provide feedback to users (e.g., success or error messages) in a non-intrusive way when they perform actions like creating or editing posts.
