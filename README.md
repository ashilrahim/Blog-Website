Blog Website
Welcome to the Blog Website! This full-stack web application is powered by the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js—to deliver a seamless and dynamic blogging experience where users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

Overview
This project leverages the MERN stack to create a responsive and interactive platform with JavaScript running on both the front end and back end. With robust authentication, file upload capabilities, a rich text editor, and toast notifications, this website offers everything needed to manage blog posts efficiently.

What is the MERN Stack?
MongoDB: A flexible, NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents, ideal for handling large amounts of data.
Express: A server-side framework for Node.js that simplifies building robust web applications.
React: A powerful JavaScript library for building fast, responsive user interfaces.
Node.js: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed server-side.
Features
User Authentication
JWT (JSON Web Token): Provides secure access to protected routes after login.
bcrypt: Enhances password security by hashing user passwords.
File Uploads
Multer: Allows users to upload images to personalize their blog posts.
Rich Text Editor
Quill: A user-friendly editor with rich text formatting options to create engaging blog content.
Notifications
Toast Notifications: Provides real-time feedback to users for actions like post creation, updates, and errors.
